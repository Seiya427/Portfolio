        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Suriya, a 15 year old student from England. I have always been intrigued by STEM, especially mathematics, but computer science and programming is something I find very fun as well. Over the past few years, I have picked up many skills, and have used programming as a way to further my knowledge of mathematics, statistics and physics as well. I'm not quite sure what my plans are for the future, but a degree in computer science or machine learning, or even a job in software engineering would appeal to me. </p>

        <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Machine learning</h3>
            <p>K-Means Clustering Implementation:</p>
                <p>In this project, I implemented the K-means clustering algorithm, which is commonly used in analysing patters in data. Using it, I was able to analyse very large data sets, including <a href = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)."> a series of transactions</a>
                     letting me find out about shopping habits across various countries. Commercially, K-means is used in similar scenarios, using data collected from the user to find out what kind of person they are. This was a very fun project that has taught me lots about unsupervised learning
                </p>
                <p>Generative Pre-trained Transformer:</p>
                This project involved developing a GPT model to generate natural language and answer prompts. This was quite a fun task, and I used it to strengthen my python skills, and learn about how to use pyTorch, a commonly used python module for machine learning. I've learned lots about how a neural network works, and how we can train them to fulfill a task as well as possible.</p>
                <p>
                Image Recognition System:</p>
                <p>In this project, I developed an image recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I used this to differentiate between animals, and also to identify numbers and letters from handwriting. This again served as an opportunity to learn lots about machine learning, and different neural network architectures, and I also was inspired to look more into the maths behind machine learning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Games</h3>
            <p>I found the best way of learning python, introducing myself to advanced programming concepts such as OOP, and making more maintainable code, was to code games I was familliar with. I also was able to learn how to make GUIs using the tkinter module. I have so far made the following games:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hangman</li>
                <li>Noughts and crosses</li>
                <li>Connect four</li>
                <li>Chess</li>
                <li>Minesweeper</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Other projects</h3>
            <p>Graphical calculator:</p>
            <p>In this project, I made a GUI calculator which was able to manipulate and graph functions. Inspired by the Geogebra graphical calculator, this project also came with other personalised features such as function inversion, integration and differentiation.</p>
            <p>Youtube video to mp3 converter:</p>
            <p>I have to admit, this project is technically illegal, but it was really fun to make and is quite useful. The project provides a user interface of youtube and enables the user to search for videos, but instead of watching the videos, it enables you to download the sound or video file to watch / listen to offline.</p>
            <p>French verb conjugation:</p>
            <p>This project was made in order to helpme revise for my French GCSE, and was quite useful. It enables the user to either input a verb in french and conjugate it to a tense, mood and person of choice, or be tested on how to conjugate the words.</p>
            <p>RSA Encryption:</p>
            <p>In this project, I implemented the RSA cryptography algorithm, which is used in our daily lives to protect our data on the internet. In addition, I implemented shor's algorithm, a quantum computing algorithm that enables you to crack RSA. This was useful as it enabled me to learn about quantum computing, and how to use APIs in order to gain access to a quantum computer.</p>

        <h2>Programming Skills</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>I love designing all kinds of things, from UIs to logos. This portfolio is also my first website, and it has bean really fun to design. I also love art, designing with a pencil, or digitally on procreate. In general, coming up with ideas is one of the funnest parts of projects, and its even more satisfying to bring these ideas to life.</p>
        
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>Coding up a project is always fun, and is an opportunity to learn lots of new languages. I started off first learning python, but while I have become fluent in C++, I still enjoy using python the most. I've also learnt to use SQL to query and build databases, and frequently use excel and R to present data and make complex calculations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Background in Mathematics and Data Science</h3>
            <p>While it may not always be said, a huge part of computer science relies on mathematics and statistics. I personally have done extensive work into many fields which lay the foundation for many projects, such as number theory and quantum mechanics for my RSA project, and linear algebra and regression analysis for much of my machine learning work.</p>

        <h2>Other Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>F1 in schools</h3>
            <p>Over the past three years, I have taken part in the F1 in schools competition, which involves manufacturing a miniature F1 car and writing up a portfolio about the design process. By competing, even though I have never won, I have strengthened my knowledge of physics, and have improved my ability to create 3D models using CAD and present my work in a design portfolio. I have also gained the ability to work well in a team and also lead a group, which I believe is very important, and also to stand strong and continue working despite many struggles along the way.</p>
